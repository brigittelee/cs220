      <p class="description">
        I've been consistently working as a Lead Strategist for Bridge Strategy since freshman year summer. Bridge Strategy is a remote company that recruits college consultants
        who could offer fresh Gen-Z perspectives for small business owners and organizations. Throughout the year, I've learned a lot about successful business strategies as well as
        compelling monetization methods. Here is an insight piece I wrote on <a href="https://www.bridgestrategypartners.com/insights/identifying-efficacious-social-media-partnerships">Identifying Efficacious Social Media Partnerships</a>.

      <p class="description">
        Briefly for about six months last year, I worked as an Engagement Intern at Climatebase, a non-profit organization dedicated to expanding and promoting the community of climate-conscious
        people. There, I helped scout various organizations and companies striving towards producing plant products, educating the population, creating innovative technologies to help slow down global warming, and many more.
        This experience inspired me to make it a goal of mine to use my knowledge and skills to spread the importance of fighting for climate change.

        Individually, I started studying UI/UX design whenever I have time outside of school and work. I hope to create opportunities for small business owners and younger students by offering them
        my service as a web designer, but I still have a long way to go before I'll be able to create a great, functioning website for my future clients.

      <p class="description">
        Although I'm an econ major, I haven't had much professional training in anything related. As I take a year abroad at London School of Economics and Political Science this year, I hope to build
        more experience in environmental business and finance and possibly investment banking. I'm open to anything, really. I simply want as many experiences as possible.
